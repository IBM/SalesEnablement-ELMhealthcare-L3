The goal of this demonstration guide is to provide sellers and technical sellers from IBM and Business Partners with the knowledge and tools to perform hands-on demonstrations of IBM Engineering Lifecycle Management. Throughout this demonstration guide IBM Engineering Lifecycle Management will be referred to as COS. While everyone is encouraged to complete all sections of the demonstration guide, actual completion requirements vary by role: IBM Sales: Complete Parts 1 through 5 of this demonstration guide Record and submit a Stand and Deliver demonstration to be evaluated by management (details in the Your Learning plan) IBM Technical Sales: Complete all Parts of this demonstration guide Record and submit a Stand and Deliver demonstration to be evaluated by management (details in the Your Learning plan) Business Partner Sales: Complete Parts 1 through 5 of this demonstration guide Successfully pass a 5 question quiz found in the learn.ibm.com plan Business Partner Sales: Complete all Parts of this demonstration guide Successfully pass a 5 question quiz found in the learn.ibm.com plan IBM Sales and Tech Sales must develop and record a Stand & Deliver presentation. This video is intended to simulate delivery of a \u201clive\u201d demo in front of a client \u2014 on camera. IBMers will have flexibility in defining a hypothetical client, the pain points the customer has, and the goals they aspire to achieve. The recording will then cover the seller\u2019s hands-on demonstration and pitch to the client of the value of the IBM solution using the environment and techniques of this lab. Specific criteria that must be demonstrated as part of the Stand & Deliver recordings is provided within the documentation that accompanies the Level 3 course in Your Learning. Business Partners must pass an accreditation quiz after completing the hands-on portion of the course. The quiz consists of multiple choice questions, with four possible responses (and only one correct answer) for each question. Hint: keep the demonstration guide and the associated IBM Technology Zone (TechZone) environment active while completing the quiz. Before jumping to part 1, please read the guidance below. Reading and understanding the information will save time while completing the steps in this guide. Helpful tips for using this demonstration guide and environment The IBM Engineering Lifecycle Management - Level 3 Demonstration Guide is organized in parts and sub-parts or chapters. Most chapters contain numbered steps, which are actions to be performed. Throughout the guide, images are used to help guide students through the demonstration. Warning The IBM Engineering Lifecycle Management user interface changes on a regular basis. Images captured in this guide may differ from the live demonstration environment in TechZone. The following styles of highlighting are utilized in images: Action highlight box: Illustrates where to click, enter, or select an item: Path/explore highlight box: Illustrates one of two things: the path to follow to get to a specific location in the user interface areas to explore To assist in navigating the browser-based user interface (UI), a birds-eye view of the UI is often provided.

It also includes reporting and analysis across all lifecycle artifacts. You can learn more about the Jazz platform here . In this demonstration, see how an infusion pump was engineered using the IBM ELM solution, in alignment with industry standards like ISO 13485 and IEC 62304 for development and ISO 14971 for risk management. The demonstration is divided into four acts: Act 1 - Design Planning and Dash-boarding. This act includes an introduction to the ELM platform and how the development work for the infusion pump is planned and tracked. Act 2 - Product Requirements. In Act 2, look at the key capabilities associated with requirements management including traceability and audit trails. Act 3 - Design Input. In this act, examine how customer requirements are traced down to system requirements, how those requirements are checked for quality and reviewed for correctness, and how baselines are created with electronic signatures. In addition, learn how to perform risk management activities. Act 4 - Design Output. Next, learn how design verification is performed to prove requirement coverage and design validation is performed to demonstrate test case coverage, test case execution, and defect tracking. Act 5 - Engineering Insights for Metrics. NEED A DESCRIPTION WRITTEN FOR THIS!!!!

Hint Prior to performing a client facing demonstration, it is beneficial to run through all the steps of the demonstration prior to doing so in front of the client. Doing so will cache all the web pages which will save a significant amount of load time. This will improve the performance of the environment and alleviate any awkward moments waiting for pages to load. Sample narration In this demonstration we\u2019ll see how an infusion pump was engineered using the IBM ELM solution, in alignment with industry standards like ISO13485 and IEC 62304 for development and ISO 14971 for risk management. We\u2019ll break the demo up into four acts: Starting with Design Planning. Here we\u2019ll get an introduction to the platform and take a look at how the development work for our Infusion Pump is planned and tracked. Then we\u2019ll take a look at Product Requirements where we\u2019ll see some of the key capabilities around requirements management including traceability and audit trails. After that we\u2019ll move on to Design Input where we\u2019ll see how customer requirements are traced down to system requirements, how those requirements are checked for quality and reviewed for correctness and how we create baselines with electronic signatures. We\u2019ll also see how we can perform risk management activities. After that we\u2019ll move to Design Output where we\u2019ll see Design Verification to prove coverage of the requirements by the design and Design Validation where we\u2019ll show test coverage, test execution and defect tracking.
