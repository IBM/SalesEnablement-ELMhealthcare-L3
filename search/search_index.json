The video below illustrates how this Act of the ELM demonstration can be performed for a client. Sample narration Let\u2019s start here on the infusion pump team dashboard. Dashboarding is a common capability across the ELM platform. Dashboards can be created for the project, for teams, or personal dashboards can be created for individual users. Dashboards give instant access to the project data that's most relevant to you, whether you\u2019re a Test Engineer looking at the current defect list or a Project Manager looking at the status of the project. And what\u2019s more - the data presented in the Dashboards is always up to date. For example, here on the General tab of our team dashboard we have a widget showing a graph of how many system requirements have linked test cases and how many don't. We\u2019ll see a few more later as we\u2019ll be using this dashboard as a jumping off point to various parts of the demonstration. Let's start with this Design Planning tab. Here we see various widgets focused on the planning aspects of our project \u2013 we\u2019ll come back to those in a moment but first let's follow this link to the practice content. Practice content is a library of guidance for a specific workflow or standard that not only documents the process but provides guidance to engineers in their day-to-day work. Here for example we are looking at the practice library for the IEC 62304 standard which provides best practices for embedded software development for medical devices. Over here on the left, if we expand this category we can see the high level objectives of IEC 62304. If, on the other hand, we expand this category we can see that there is a delivery process which is a detailed, prescriptive workflow including activities and tasks on how to satisfy those objectives. Of course you can use your own process or customize this one. Let\u2019s select the SW Development Process Objective. Here we can see a detailed list of the Objectives under that heading. 5.1 is all about planning, 5.2 is about requirements, 5.3 is focused on architecture and so on. By way of example lets click on 5.7.1 \u2013 which is all about verification \u2013 and specifies that the Software (SW) Verification Tests shall cover all requirements and include inputs, outputs and selected outcomes. Below the Objective we can see how it is mapped to the workflow. There is a list of the related elements in the detailed workflow guidance that helps our engineering teams to actually meet these objectives. Let's dive into one of those \u2013 the task to develop test cases. Here we can see the various roles involved, the input and output work products from the task and detailed, step-by-step guidance on how to perform the task and achieve the objective. The guidance can even go so far as to describe how to perform the task in a specific tool \u2013 we call those tool mentors. Let's move back to our dashboard and take a look at how all of that guidance translates into actual work products. In order to comply with IEC62304 and ISO13485, we have to have a plan. Our Infusion Pump has a plan which, in this case, is organized using iterative agile principles. At the bottom, we can see the development plans including one for each program increment and an overall solution roadmap. Those development plans contain concepts from standard agile practices including epics, features, stories, and tasks \u2013 in a moment we\u2019ll dive into one of those development plans and take a closer look, but here on our dashboard we can get a clear view of the status of the project in many different ways. For example, on the left is a graph of all of the work items in the solution roadmap, grouped by their owner. On the right we can see some specific views that help with prioritizing the work according to agile principles. At the bottom, we can see a traceability graph of where our features, capabilities and so on have been traced to requirements, design architecture, and test cases. Let us open the Solution Roadmap. Here we have two high level epics including this one - Deliver an external Infusion Pump. If we expand that epic we can see that it is broken down into Capabilities, and if we expand the Deliver Therapy capability, we can see that those are broken down into Features, and if we expand this Initiate Drug infusion Feature we can see that\u2019s been broken down into User Stories. Over on the right we can see which program increment or sprint these artifacts are planned for. But there are also detailed tasks that have to be performed at each of these levels and those tasks map back to the practice content we saw earlier as well as the classical V-Lifecycle. If I switch the view to show those tasks in the tree, we can see at Capability level we have tasks for both sides of the top of the V Lifecycle - On the left hand side we perform functional analysis for the deliver therapy use case and on the right, perform system qualification testing for that same use case. At Feature level, we move down the V and the tasks are around the development of a system architecture, and system integration testing. And if we expand this story, we can move further down and the tasks are at the software level \u2013 developing and testing software architectures. This is only one of many views we can use to consume and modify our planning data. For example, here is a classic Kanban view. We can move work items through the process quickly and easily by dragging and dropping between these columns. Hint Prior to performing a client facing demonstration, it is beneficial to run through all the steps of the demonstration prior to doing so in front of the client. Doing so will cache all the web pages which will save a significant amount of load time. This will improve the performance of the environment and alleviate any awkward moments waiting for pages to load. The following steps provide an overview of the ELM dashboard and the concept of \"dash boarding\". Click the Design Planning tab on the Infusion Pump Requirements Project Dashboard .

Sample narration Now let's look at Product Requirements. Let's return to our dashboard and take a look at the requirement Artifacts for the infusion pump. Here we can see that we have Modules \u2013 or documents of requirements organized at various levels. As you\u2019ll see in a few minutes, the requirements in those documents are all connected. Let's open the Product Requirements document and take a closer look. These requirements reflect the end user's needs. There are other documents reflecting regulatory requirements, system requirements, software requirements, etc. Here we have a rich editing environment including pictures, rich text, table, and more. The document has hierarchy \u2013 for example if we collapse the document, we can see it has major sections; an introduction, a general description of the product, and then more detailed requirements. If we expand the specific requirements section, we can see those requirements are organized into functional, performance, operational, and so on. Another important facet of good requirements management is granularity. Every sketch, requirement, and heading in this document is an independent, atomic artifact which means that it can be directly referenced. As you will see later, traceability is between atomic artifacts rather than documents. It also means that multiple users can all edit this same document at the same time, and It facilitates re-use at the granular level - an artifact can be added to multiple documents, so no more copy and paste and the overhead that comes with it. Artifacts have type \u2013 for example, this document has Headings, Information Items, and Product Requirements. Product Requirements have a Priority and a Status whilst the other types do not. A strong typing system like this reduces typographical errors and improves the consistency and report-ability of the data. Note that here we\u2019ve applied a view to quickly switch from the document style we saw previously to a spreadsheet style. Any of the artifact attributes may be shown as columns, and views can also filter the data \u2013 for example, this view shows only Product Requirements, along with their priority and status. This allows the user to quickly focus on what is important. Notice at the top of the page here is a notification that if we want to make any changes to this document, then we have to do that as part of a change set. This project has been placed under change control. This allows the team to manage the impact of changes, as well as ensuring that changes are only made with the appropriate approvals and that those changes are properly documented. Any changes that are made are automatically tracked and maintained for an audit trail. We can view the history of a single requirement \u2013 or in this case the entire document. This Audit History shows us every change that was made. Who made it, when it happened, the exact nature of the change and the change set in which it was made. Now let us look at traceability which is mandated in ISO 13485. Traditionally, traceability is maintained in separate documents such as spreadsheets \u2013 a manual process, prone to error, very costly to maintain, and outdated as soon as the author clicks \u201csave\u201d. In the ELM platform traceability is added directly to the artifacts themselves \u2013 right here in the web browser. This view shows us not only the product requirements for the Infusion Pump but also the system requirements further downstream that satisfy them. For example \u2013 this product requirement \u2013 4968 is satisfied by this system requirement 4812. If we hover our mouse over a linked requirement \u2013 like 4812, we can see another common capability across the platform \u2013 Rich Hover. Whenever there is a link to another engineering artifact, the key information about it is seen without actually following the link. That might be a linked requirement as in this case, but it might also be a requirements engineer looking at a linked design \u2013 or a test engineer looking at a requirement they are testing against. It\u2019s a huge time saver. We can also easily see Gap Analysis \u2013 which of these requirements has no traceability downstream \u2013 for example, here requirement 5023 has no system level coverage. Of course that kind of information is also easily exposed onto dashboards \u2013 as we\u2019ll see later. Here we can see Link Validity. Whenever two artifacts are linked \u2013 if one of those artifacts changes then the connection between them becomes suspect. Here for example the link between 4968 and 4812 is suspect because one of those requirements got changed. Now an analysis is required to confirm that the link is still valid. The ELM Platform automatically highlights when this happens, so making that assessment is much easier and of course this is another common feature so that also applies for the linked models, test cases, and so on. Click the Chrome bookmark Project Dashboards and select the Infusion Pump bookmark. Warning Do not try to click Project Dashboard in the menu bar as that will open the Change and Configuration Management (CCM) project dashboard and not the Requirements Management (RM) dashboard. Click the Artifacts tab in the main header bar. Birds-eye View Click on each folder in turn to show the hierarchy of requirements documents (Modules). Take note of the various Artifact Types of the documents, such as the 04 Hazard and Risk Analysis artifact types shown below.

Note the various categories of requirements defined. Click the icon next to the 3.1 Functional Requirements content item. Click checkbox next to the first functional requirement: This device shall use a valve... . Notice that each object in the document is an independent, atomic artifact. This enables multiple engineers to author and edit the document at the same time. When a requirement is being edited, it is automatically locked preventing others from editing it, but other objects can be edited by others. It also facilitates reuse as any of these artifacts can be used in multiple documents without having to copy and paste content. Click the 1. Artifact Attributes link in the Views panel. Birds-eye view Notice that each artifact can be of a different type, and have different attributes based upon the type. A strong typing system reduces typographical errors and improves the consistency and report-ability of the data. Click the 2. Product Requirements link in the Views panel.

Please review the video below to learn about RQA and then proceed to the next chapter. The video below illustrates how this Act of the ELM demonstration can be performed for a client. Sample narration Next, let us look at Design Input. We are starting where we left off \u2013 here in the Product Requirements document, looking at the traceability downstream to System Requirements. Now, let us follow one of those links. We are now looking at the System Requirements document. If we apply this view, we can see the traceability back to the product requirements upstream as well as to the software requirements downstream. For example, system requirement 4812 satisfies product requirement 4968 and itself is satisfied by three software requirements. Next we\u2019ll put these requirements through a review cycle, but before we do that we\u2019re going to use the power of AI to check and improve their quality. It\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll need to edit the requirements so let us start by creating a Change Set to encapsulate those changes. Note that our engineer Susan is now working in her own private area \u2013 any changes made here are isolated from the rest of the team until they are delivered. In a real project we would trace this change set to a work item, and the platform can even be configured so that we cannot deliver any changes back to the team without a work item with the appropriate approvals on it \u2013 you will see those approvals in a moment when we look at reviews. For now let us just check our requirements. This view filters the document to show only System Requirements and also adds columns for some attributes that will store the result of our quality check \u2013 which is useful for reporting later. Let's select all of our requirements and ask the Requirements Quality Assistant or RQA to check them. RQA analyses the requirements using Watson Natural Language Processing and then scores them against the rules defined in the INCOSE Requirements Engineering handbook \u2013 or indeed against custom rulesets for specific projects or domains. Here we can see that most of the requirements have scored well \u2013 and a couple need some work. Take a look at one of those. First RQA gives us the reason for the score \u2013 in this case we have an Unclear Term \u2013 the phrase 'In A Clear manner' is ambiguous and subjective which makes it very difficult to test. Detailed guidance on how to improve poorly written requirements is included \u2013 an essential tool to help less experienced requirement writers improve their skills. Note that this isn\u2019t something as simple as a keyword search \u2013 the requirement below this one also has the word clear in it \u2013 but in that context it\u2019s not ambiguous and the requirement scores 100. RQA goes beyond simple keyword searches. It can understand context, meaning and intent. We can fix that requirement fairly easily \u2013 in this case that ambiguous phrase is actually not needed at all so let's remove it \u2013 and then ask RQA to recheck that requirement. Identifying and fixing quality issues like ambiguous, incomplete and poorly structured requirements before a review saves time and reduces cost. Domain experts can spend their valuable time reviewing the intent of a requirement rather than wasting time fixing things like inconsistencies. In a real project, we would fix all of the issues, deliver the requirements back to the team, and create a baseline of the requirements ready for the review. As this is a demo, I\u2019ve already created that baseline and the review, so I\u2019m just going to discard this change set and then I\u2019ll switch from Susan's personal editing area back to the team area. As per ISO 13485, requirements need to be approved and reviewed. Let's return to our dashboard and see how a review cycle takes place. Here we have a work item to review the System Requirements for the Infusion Pump. Here on the Approvals tab there are several approvals that are required to complete this work \u2013 the reviews themselves and a final managerial approval. Here on the Links tab there are several links. The review baseline is the document that our reviewers have been asked to review. This child task is an issue that was raised during the review. Lastly the approved baseline is a link to the baselined document after the review was completed and the requirements were approved. Let's start by clicking the Review baseline link. Note that the system requirements document has opened \u2013 but in the context of a Baseline, and so these artifacts are all frozen and cannot be edited. Let's go back to the work item and click the child task. Here we can see that this is an issue raised by one of our reviewers, Dan, and he\u2019s assigned the work item to Susan to resolve. At the bottom we can see a description of Dan\u2019s issue \u2013 he doesn\u2019t think the requirement is complete enough and has also identified a potential missing requirement. Further down we can see that Susan has replied \u2013 she agreed and made some changes to the document in response to the review comment. On the Approvals tab, Dan added himself as the approver. Note that the parent review work item would not have been allowed to close until all of its children were also approved and closed \u2013 so any issues raised during the review would prevent it from completing until they were addressed. On the links tab, there is a link to the requirement that had a problem \u2013 which helped Susan identify it in the document. Let's follow that link and take a look. Again we are in the context of the review baseline and the requirement reads 'The system shall perform a self test on initiation.' As we saw in the work item, Susan agreed with the review comment that it was not complete enough and made some changes \u2013 after that, the review work item was approved and closed, and another baseline was taken and electronically signed. Let\u2019s switch to that baseline and see what happened. It may not be immediately obvious what the changes were, but the ELM Platform allows us to compare artifacts to see any differences \u2013 in this case let\u2019s compare this approved baseline to the original review baseline. Here we can see the additional requirement that Susan added as well as the existing requirement that was modified \u2013 highlighted in blue. We can dive deeper into that requirement and see the modifications that were made. Let's now close that comparison and return to the document. Next we can follow this link to the actual approved baseline where we can see its electronic signature. Now let\u2019s look at risk management. First we\u2019ll return to our project dashboard and once again we\u2019ll switch back to the main team working area. Here on our dashboard we have two tabs of interest \u2013 Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FEMA) and Operational Hazard Analysis. There are many similarities between the two \u2013 they both examine failure modes, effects, and causes. The primary difference is that operational hazard analysis focuses on what could go wrong if the product is used incorrectly, whilst FMEA focuses on the identification of possible failures in the design of the product components. Let's start with FMEA. Our dashboard is surfacing the results of the FMEA analysis in a consumable way \u2013 for example, at the top here we have a traceability view from the system requirement to a potential failure related to that requirement, and to the safety requirement that was created to mitigate against the risk of that happening. On the right we have more of a metrics view \u2013 how many failure modes are mitigated by safety requirements and how many are not. These are not just pictures; this is all live data. Let\u2019s use the traceability view to navigate into the FMEA document and see the analysis. Here we can see the columns of information that allow us to perform the FMEA \u2013 the identified failure mode, the effects of that failure, its potential, causes and any current controls we have in place. Those assessments allow us to assign numeric values for Severity, Probability, and Detection \u2013 and those can then be used to calculate the Risk Priority Number (RPN), which is a simple measure of comparison. The platform can help by automating steps and performing calculations on the data. Let's see an example of this in action. We\u2019ll start by making a change set so we can make some changes to this data. Then let's edit this Risk Priority Number and actually delete that value. Now in our mini-dashboard we can expand this RPN Calculator, which will perform that calculation for us and populate the field again. Of course that\u2019s a very simple example and a very simple calculation, but it shows how the basic capabilities of the platform may be extended with automation widgets like these. Let's go ahead and discard that change set \u2013 and as before we\u2019ll also switch back to the team area. Back on our Project Dashboard, let's now select Operational Hazard Analysis. That analysis is performed in much the same way as FMEA with the major difference being that these hazards are the result of user error rather than device failure. The ELM Platform allows for automatic generation of federated documentation. Here we have a link to an automatically generated document that combines both of those analyses into a Risk Management File. Next, examine the Review process in ELM.","title":"Requirements Quality Assistant"},{"location":"Part%204/02%20Reviews/","text":"Click the Project Dashboard tab in the top header bar.
