The following steps must be performed before delivering the demonstration. These steps should be performed several minutes prior to starting an actual client demonstration as the software services used take a few minutes to start and enter a ready state.

## Prepare the browser-based web client

1. Open a browser window/tab using the URL found in the IBM Technology Zone email with the subject line "Your environment is ready".

If prompted for a **Virtual machine access** password like in the image below, enter the **Desktop password** specified in the IBM Technology Zone email with the subject line "Your environment is ready" (highlighted in the above image) and click **Submit**.

2. Click the **play** button to start the demonstration virtual machine (VM).

The **Infusion Pump** demonstration dashboard is built of many different **widgets** as seen in the image below. When first loaded, some of the widgets may return an error (e.g. Error 400). This is expected and will be resolved later.

<!-- At this point the **Infusion Pump** dashboard should be fully loaded with out errors. If not, wait a minute and click the browser refresh icon ![](_attachments/ChromeRefresh.png). Repeat if necessary. -->
To fix the broken widgets, slowly click through each of the **Infusion Pump Requirements Project Dashboard's** tabs. If after returning to the **General** tab the widget at far right is still reporting an error, try clicking the browser's refresh/reload button. Repeat this process a couple of times, the errors should resolve and data will appear in those widgets.

In **Act 1**, begin the journey to learn how to demonstrate IBM Engineering Lifecycle Management (ELM). Note, this is not a deep dive into IBM ELM, rather a brief overview of some of the major capabilities and benefits.
