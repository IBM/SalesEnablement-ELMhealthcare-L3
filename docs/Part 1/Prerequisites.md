The ELM environment utilized in this demonstration guide was recently ported from Skytap in IBM Technology Zone (ITZ) to a VMware image running in ITZ. When accessing the running VM using the web-based remote desktop, the screen resolution appears very small (at least on when run on browsers on MacOS). While you can complete the demonstration guide using the web-based remote desktop the small resolution may make it difficult and/or frustrating.  Users are encouraged to utilize the Microsoft Remote Desktop application or a similar application.

## Apple MacOS users

Microsoft Remote Desktop is available for free on the Apple App Store. To install the application, open the Apple App Store application and search on "Microsoft Remote Desktop".

Click the **Get**  button and then click the **Open** button after the install completes.

## Microsoft Windows users

The Microsoft Remote Desktop application should already be available on the Windows operating system, but if it is not, it can be installed from the Microsoft Store. A good tutorial on using the Remote Desktop application can be found <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-use-remove-desktop-app-connect-pc-windows-10-0" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Linux users

There are various Linux remote desktop clients available. The author of this guide does not have first-hand experience with these so determining which one to use will be up to the user. Sorry.
