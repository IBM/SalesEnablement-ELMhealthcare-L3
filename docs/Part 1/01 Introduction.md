The {{offering.name}} solution or ELM, built on the Jazz platform, provides an integrated solution for systems and software engineering: requirements and risk management, models for systems design, test management, and workflow management which includes task, change management, and configuration management. It also includes reporting and analysis across all lifecycle artifacts.

You can learn more about ELM <a href="https://www.ibm.com/products/engineering-lifecycle-management" target="_blank">here</a> and the Jazz platform <a href="https://jazz.net/" target="_blank">here</a>.

In this demonstration, see how an infusion pump was engineered using the IBM ELM solution, in alignment with industry standards like <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/59752.html" target="_blank">ISO 13485</a> and <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/38421.html" target="_blank">IEC 62304</a> for development and <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/72704.html" target="_blank">ISO 14971</a> for risk management.

This demonstration assumes users have at least basic knowledge of {{offering.name}}. Before proceeding, it is highly encouraged that users complete the Engineering Lifecycle Management Fundamentals Level 1 learning plan. The plan is accessible to IBM employees <a href="https://yourlearning.ibm.com/activity/PLAN-105F0A636B9F" target="_blank">here</a> and Business Partners <a href="https://learn.ibm.com/course/view.php?id=11806" target="_blank">here</a>.

The demonstration is divided into four acts:

Act 1 - Design Planning and Dash-boarding. This act includes an introduction to the ELM platform and how the development work for the infusion pump is planned and tracked.

Act 2 - Product Requirements. In Act 2, look at the key capabilities associated with requirements management including traceability and audit trails.

Act 3 - Design Input. In this act, examine how customer requirements are traced down to system requirements, how those requirements are checked for quality and reviewed for correctness, and how baselines are created with electronic signatures. In addition, learn how to perform risk management activities.

Act 4 - Design Output. Next, learn how design verification is performed to prove requirement coverage and design validation is performed to demonstrate test case coverage, test case execution, and defect tracking.

Act 5 - Engineering Insights for Metrics. NEED A DESCRIPTION WRITTEN FOR THIS!!!!

Before proceeding to the actual demonstration, a few preparation steps must be complete first to configure the demonstration environment in IBM Technology Zone.
