    As per ISO 13485, requirements need to be approved and reviewed. Lets return to our dashboard and see how a review cycle takes place. Here we have a work item to review the System Requirements for the Infusion Pump. Here on the approvals tab there are several approvals that are required to complete this work – the reviews themselves and a final managerial approval. Here on the links tab there are several links: The review baseline is the document that our reviewers have been asked to review.  This child task is an issue that was raised during the review and lastly the approved baseline is a link to the baselined document after the review was completed and the requirements were approved.

    Lets start by clicking the Review baseline link. Note that the system requirements document has opened – but in the context of a Baseline, and so these artifacts are all frozen and cannot be edited.

    Lets go back to the work item and click the child task. Here we can see that this is an Issue – raised by one of our reviewers, Dan, and he’s assigned the work item to Susan to resolve. At the bottom we can see a description of Dan’s issue – he doesn’t think the requirement is complete enough and has also identified a potential missing requirement. Further down we can see that Susan has replied – she agreed and made some changes to the document in response to the review comment.

    On the Approvals tab, Dan added himself as the approver. Note that the parent review work item would not have been allowed to close until all of its children were also approved and closed – so any issues raised during the review would prevent it from completing until they were addressed.

    On the links tab there is a link to the requirement that had a problem – which helped Susan identify it in the document. Lets follow that link and take a look.

    Again we are in the context of the review baseline and the requirement reads The system shall perform a self test on initiation. As we saw in the work item, Susan agreed with the review comment that is was not complete enough and made some changes – after that the review work item was approved and closed, and another baseline was taken and electronically signed. Let’s switch to that baseline and see what happened. It may not be immediately obvious what the changes were but the ELM Platform allows us to compare artifacts to see any differences – in this case let’s compare this approved baseline to the original review baseline.

    Here we can see the additional requirement that Susan added as well as the existing requirement that was modified – highlighted in blue. We can dive deeper into that requirement and see the modifications that were made.

    Lets now close that comparison and return to the document. Next we can follow this link to the actual approved baseline where we can see its electronic signature.
