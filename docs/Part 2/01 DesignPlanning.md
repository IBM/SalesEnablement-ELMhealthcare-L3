This demonstration flow is organized around the development process described in <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/59752.html" target="_blank">ISO 13485</a> and <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/72704.html" target="_blank">ISO 14971</a> for risk management.

!!! hint
    Prior to performing a client facing demonstration, it is beneficial to run through all the steps of the demonstration prior to doing so in front of the client. Doing so will cache all the web pages which will save a significant amount of load time. This will improve the performance of the environment and alleviate any awkward moments waiting for pages to load.

    In this demonstration we’ll see how an infusion pump was engineered using the IBM ELM solution, in alignment with industry standards like ISO13485 and IEC 62304 for development and ISO 14971 for risk management. We’ll break the demo up into four acts:

    Starting with Design Planning. Here we’ll get an introduction to the platform and take a look at how the development work for our Infusion Pump is planned and tracked.

    Then we’ll take a look at Product Requirements where we’ll see some of the key capabilities around requirements management including traceability and audit trails.

    After that we’ll move on to Design Input where we’ll see how customer requirements are traced down to system requirements, how those requirements are checked for quality and reviewed for correctness and how we create baselines with electronic signatures. We’ll also see how we can perform risk management activities.

    After that we’ll move to Design Output where we’ll see Design Verification to prove coverage of the requirements by the design and Design Validation where we’ll show test coverage, test execution and defect tracking.

The following steps provide an overview of the ELM dashboard and the concept of "dash boarding".
